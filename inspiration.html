            A unique identity of mine is fashion. I love to dress apart from others and dressing up uniquely is something I genuinely enjoy. 
            There are many ways to differ yourself from the public such as giving a twist in your silhouette or using uncommon materials.
            However, one of my favorite ways to contrast myself with others is using colors. Naturally, being interested in both 
            fashion and colors, Pantone  became a familiar face and became an inspiration for this page.
